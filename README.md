# MLQuest Hackathon: Air Quality Prediction
## Project Overview
This repository contains a machine learning solution for predicting air quality indices using regression models. The project was developed for the MLQuest hackathon, which involved solving three problem statements: predicting air quality, identifying fake job listings, and predicting flight prices. Our focus was on predicting air quality using regression techniques.

## Data
The dataset used for this project includes columns such as City, Date, PM2.5, PM10, NO, NO2, NOx, NH3, CO, SO2, O3, Benzene, Toluene, Xylene, AQI, and AQI_Bucket. The data is collected from various sources and provides a comprehensive view of air quality.



Cross-validation R^2 scores: [0.9727501  0.97678441 0.97998063 0.97771337 0.97634234]
Mean CV R^2 score: 0.9767
